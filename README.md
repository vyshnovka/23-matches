# Tiny games on Prolog

This repository contains some classic (kinda) board games implemented in Prolog.    
Unless, of course, you can say "some" about "two".

**Tic-Tac-Toe**
    
For those who hear about this legendary game for the first time...    
The first one to place three of their marks vertically, horizontally or diagonally wins. Simple as that.   

**23 Matches**

The essence of this game consists in removing things off the table.    
In one move, a player can pick up one, two or three matches. Whoever is forced to pick up the last match loses.
